            Hello I am Naim AlOmari, I was born in Abudahbi (1996) I lived there my first 20 years, then I moved to
            Jordan to study civil engineering at AlYarmouk University (2013-2018), Actually it was a very hard
            decisions.
            I worked as a civil engineer in ALMANASEER READY MIX which is located in amman, then I moved to AlJUBAIL
            Contacting Company as a site civil engineer and I was a victim of this epidemic ( corona virus or covid 19
            ).
            I knew that web developing is the most opening field, so I decide to learn more about it and try to do my
            best in this field, so I can go ahead with my future.
            my aim of joining this course is to try to mix between the civil engineering and the software developing.
